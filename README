Astro is a small, simple web framework for Lua. It targets the 5.2
release and is released under the ISC license.

Project moved to sourcehut: https://git.sr.ht/~jturner/astro

Astro is designed to be used as a library. Running install.sh will copy
Astro to the /usr/local/share/lua/5.2 directory. Astro has no external
dependencies other than a web server to run it from.

Web applications built using Astro must follow a specific directory
structure. An extremely simple example weblog application is included to
help get you started. If you keep the current checkout's directory
structure you should be able to run the example without the need to
install Astro system wide if you don't want to. The example application
uses the luasqlite3 library found here:
https://github.com/jturner/luasqlite3.

Astro uses CGI and has a single index.cgi entry point. The website's
document root should be set to the public folder. You will also want to
make sure db/, db/blog.db and tmp/ are group writeable by the web
server.

To periodically remove old session files you may want to run something
similar to the following via cron

find /var/www/htdocs/example/tmp -type f -atime +1 -exec rm {} \;
